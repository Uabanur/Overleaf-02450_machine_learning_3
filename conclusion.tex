\subsection{Conclusion on report 3}
In this report, we have performed clustering, anomaly detection as well as association mining on our data set. 

A Gaussian Mixture Model approach was used to split our data into 7 clusters. Most of these clusters were difficult to interpret, but two of the glass types did get assigned to their own (almost) distinct clusters.

The anomaly detection did fairly convincingly reveal a few potential outliers among the data: Three different methods of detecting outliers - KDE, KNN and ARD - agreed mostly on what data points to classify as outliers.

Finally, association mining using the Apriori algorithm demonstrated a number of association rules in our dataset with high confidence, some of which were interesting and others which were less so.

But most of all, our results yet again demonstrates the complexity of the data. With more data points evenly distributed across all types, clustering and association mining might yield more valuable results.
