\textbf{Objective:} In this third of three reports, the objective is to apply methods learned in weeks 10 through 12 in the DTU course \textit{02450 Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining}. The tools focus on unsupervised learning, in particular clustering, outlier/anomaly detection, and association mining. 

Since this is the third report, it relies heavily on the results and experienced gained in Report 1 (\textit{Data: Feature extraction and visualization}) and Report 2 (\textit{Supervised learning: Classification and regression}). 

\textbf{Material and tools:} The terms and notations used correspond to the notation in the course note \cite{coursenotes}, and we make use of scripts provided by the 02450Toolbox for Python 3 and Matlab.
